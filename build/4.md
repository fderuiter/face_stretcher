# Build Step 4: To-Do List for Mario 64-Style Face Stretcher

## Current State

- UI for upload, cropping, and mesh display is in place.
- Face detection and cropping works, but the workflow is not seamless.
- 3D mesh is generated, but the Mario 64-style interactive stretching is not fully realized.
- Dragging works, but the mesh is a flat plane, not a mapped face or hemisphere.

## To-Do List

### 1. Face Detection & Cropping

- [ ] Improve workflow so face detection runs automatically after upload, and only falls back to manual crop if detection fails.
- [ ] Show a loading indicator while face detection is running.
- [ ] Ensure the cropped region is always centered on the detected face.

### 2. Mesh Generation & Mapping

- [ ] Map the cropped face image as a texture onto the mesh (currently a flat plane).
- [ ] (Optional) Switch to a hemisphere or slightly curved mesh for a more 3D effect, like Mario 64.
- [ ] Ensure mesh aspect ratio matches the cropped face region.

### 3. Interactive Dragging (Mario 64 Style)

- [ ] Make mesh vertices draggable only when pointer is near them (like Mario 64's "grab points").
- [ ] Add visual indicators (dots or handles) for draggable points (corners, mouth, cheeks, etc.).
- [ ] Allow user to drag these points and have the mesh smoothly deform and spring back.
- [ ] Add a "reset" button to snap the mesh back to its original state.

### 4. UI/UX Improvements

- [ ] Hide upload/crop UI after mesh is generated; show a "re-upload" button somewhere non-intrusive.
- [ ] Add a loading spinner or progress bar during face detection and mesh generation.
- [ ] Add tooltips or short instructions for first-time users.

### 5. Polish & Stretch Goals

- [ ] Add a toggle for "N64 Mode" (low-poly, pixelated texture) vs. "HD Mode" (high-res, smooth mesh).
- [ ] Add ability to save/share the stretched face (already partially implemented).
- [ ] Add PWA support for offline use.
- [ ] Add analytics/error tracking (optional for production).

**Next Steps:**

- Start with improving the face detection/cropping workflow and mesh mapping.
- Then, focus on interactive grab points and Mario 64-style deformation.
- Polish the UI/UX and add stretch goals as time allows.
