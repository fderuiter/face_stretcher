Here’s how you might take your POC all the way to a polished, production‑ready app—without spending a dime on hosting:

---

## 1. Feature Roadmap

### A. UX & Polish  
1. **Automatic Face‑Crop**  
   - Integrate TensorFlow.js FaceMesh or face‑api.js to auto‑detect and center the face on upload.  
   - Fall back to manual cropper only if detection fails.  
2. **Configurable “N64 Mode”**  
   - Toggle between retro (low‑poly, nearest‑filter, 128×128 texture) and HD (higher subdivisions, linear‑filter, 512×512)  
3. **Brush & Physics Presets**  
   - Let users pick “Soft,” “Bouncy,” “Stiff” or even custom sliders.  
4. **Save & Share**  
   - Generate a permalink (via a free serverless function) that re‑loads your exact stretched state.  
   - Social‑media meta tags + OpenGraph image preview.  
5. **PWA Support**  
   - Add a `manifest.json` and service worker so it “installs” on mobile and works offline once loaded.  

### B. Performance & Stability  
1. **Web Worker for Physics**  
   - Move your `updateSprings()` loop into a dedicated worker thread to keep 60 FPS even when dragging hard.  
2. **WASM Proof‑of‑Concept**  
   - Swap in our little Rust/WASM spring sim for a blazingly fast engine, especially on low‑end devices.  
3. **Adaptive Quality**  
   - Detect device performance (e.g. via FPS sampling) and automatically lower segment count or texture resolution.  
4. **Analytics & Error‑Tracking**  
   - Plug in Plausible or Google Analytics (both have free tiers for small traffic)  
   - Add Sentry’s free plan to capture JS errors in the wild.

## 2. Development Workflow

1. **GitHub Repo**  
   - Push all code to a public (or private) GitHub repo.  
2. **Continuous Integration**  
   - Add a simple GitHub Actions workflow to run linting/formatting and smoke‑test your build on every PR.  
3. **Branching Model**  
   - `main` always deploys production; `dev` branch for staging.

## 3. Free Hosting Options

| Provider              | Static + Functions                   | Notes                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vercel**            | ✓ (Static + Serverless)              | GitHub integration → deploy on push; custom domain.   |
| **Netlify**           | ✓ (Static + Netlify Functions)       | Built‑in form handling, split testing.                |
| **Cloudflare Pages**  | ✓ (Static + Workers)                 | Ultra‑low latency edge functions worldwide.           |
| **GitHub Pages**      | ✓ (Static only)                      | Free custom domain support; need GH Actions for any SSR. |
| **Render (Free)**     | ✓ (Static + Background Jobs)         | 750 hrs free/month; automatic TLS.                    |

> **Recommended:** Vercel or Cloudflare Pages for the easiest serverless‑function support.

## 4. Deployment Steps (Vercel Example)

1. **Connect to GitHub**  
   - In Vercel dashboard, click “Import Project,” pick your repo.  
2. **Configure**  
   - **Framework:** Other (Vite)  
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`  
   - **Output Dir:** `dist/`  
3. **Environment Variables**  
   - Not needed for purely client‑side.  
4. **Custom Domain**  
   - Add a free domain you own, or use `your-app.vercel.app`.  
5. **Automatic Deploys**  
   - Every push to `main` triggers a new production deployment.  

---

## 5. Maintenance & Monitoring

- **Uptime Status:** Use a free Pingdom or UptimeRobot check to alert if your site goes down.  
- **Performance Budgets:** Monitor Lighthouse scores in CI (via GitHub Actions) and block regressions.  
- **Feedback Loop:** Add a simple “Report a problem” link that opens an Issue template in your repo.

### Putting it all together

1. **Finalize** your React/Vue/Vanilla build with the features above.  
2. **Push** to GitHub and **import** into Vercel (or Netlify/Cloudflare) for zero‑cost hosting, SSL, CI/CD and even serverless endpoints for share‑links.  
3. **Iterate** on analytics and error tracking to refine performance and UX.  

With this plan, you’ll go from POC to fully featured, shareable, and production‑reliable—while still staying on entirely free hosting!
